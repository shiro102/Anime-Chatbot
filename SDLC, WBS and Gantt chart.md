## About Our Project: 
<br>

Our team chose incremental development as our SDLC model, generated a list of tasks based on each phase of the model, allocated time and manpower to each task based on duration and schedule with a WBS and a Gantt chart as explanation. Then, our team started planning for development. The role of the agent is anime expert and users are anime lovers who would love to talk about anime and know more about it. The topic of the conversation is about the general information and personal preference of anime.

## The Software Development Life Cycles:

<br>

### **Our Choice**: Incremental Development
<br>

### **Rationale**: 

<br>We choosed Incremental Development as our software development life cycle. Since more assignments about this project are expected to be published, some changes to this project might be required. As a result, we think that a model that is able to accommodate changes is most suitable for this project. Incremental development requires multiple versions of the project to be published frequently, so the model allows executable products to be generated earlier, and further modification can be done in later versions. In this way, modification is encouraged and the possibility of a complete failure of the product is reduced. The restriction of this model is that to rectify a task done in previous version requires modifications in all units and is time-consuming.

### Process: 
     1) Analyze requirements:
 	 	i) Choosing a platform to publish the application
    	           a) Creating github account for each team member
    	           b) Creating  team github account
  		ii) Choose a software development cycle
  	 	iii) Creating WBS and Gantt charts.
  
    2) Establish design:
  		i) Choose a language and its corresponding IDE
 		ii) Choose an agent chatbot.
 		iii) choose a topic for chatbot
  		iv) design the user interface for chatbot

    3) Implementing design:
  		i) Build the dataset for chatbot 
  		ii) Implement the user interface. 
  		iii) Implement back-end (Training the chatbot)	
              	 a) Choosing libraries
  		iv) Integrate the front end and back end.
  
    4) Testing:
  		i) Testing frequently asked questions.
  		ii) Testing ambiguous questions.
  		iii) testing the interactive elements
  		iv) Record errors and fix them.
			a) debugging
 			b) Add code for error prevention
			c) Supplement and complete the dataset

    5) Publishing application:
 		i) Establish publishing date
 		ii) Synchronize each memberâ€™s work
		iii) Publish the application to github
 	 	iv) Presentation
