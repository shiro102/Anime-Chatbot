**This directory contains all the code needed for this project.**

##Details:

<br>

To compile the code, we run in terminal these 2 lines of codes - “python train_chatbot.py” and “python chatgui.py”. The first code is to train the model so that the GUI might function properlyl. The second code is to run the app. 

There are five stages of the development for the code: data importing and loading, data preprocessing, data training and testing, model building, and GUI developing.

There are 6 classes used in the code: nltk, json, pickle, numpy, keras, and tkinter.
